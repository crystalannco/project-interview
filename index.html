                <h2>This year has been challenging...</h2>
                <h3>Especially for teachers</h3>
                <p>I used this opportunity to briefly interview two of the most passionate and hardworking teachers I know, and ask them what this year has been like for them.
                From adjusting to life in a pandemic to adjusting to virtual and hybrid classrooms, it hasn't been easy...
              <br>But one thing's for sure: It has been a <span>learning</span> experience!</p>

            <div class="section-one">
                <h3>What has been your biggest challenge this year?</h3>
                <p class="challenge">
                  <span>Mrs.Hines:</span> Definitely figuring out how to instruct my class using mostly technology. At the beginning of the school year we were 100% virtual, and it was a bit of a challenge figuring out the technology.<br>
                  <br><span>Ms. Colbert:</span> Effectively teaching virtual learners and getting them to form meaningful connections to the content I was teaching was difficult. Many of my students are low-income and didnâ€™t have much experience with technology. They are also first graders who are used to hands-on learning. I had to come up with ways of teaching that were engaging and held their interest, all while helping them to become more familiar with technology and how to navigate it.

            <div class="section-two">
                <h3>What was your biggest success in the classroom?</h3>
                <p class="success"><span>Mrs.Hines:</span> Finally understanding the virtual classroom was a huge win for me! Once I did that, things went a bit more smoothly. There are still some problems, but not nearly as many as before.<br>
                    <br><span>Ms. Colbert:</span> Helping  my students learn how to navigate their technology and software was a huge success. Once they understood how to do that, virtual and hybrid learning was a much smoother process. Also, getting the kids to keep their masks on!
                  </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-three">
                <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
                <p class="learn"><span>Mrs.Hines:</span> I must say that I learned that empathy is quite important. I always like for parents to have empathy and understanding towards all that goes into successfully teaching their children. However, this year I had to have empathy for parents struggling with virtual learning. Things can be difficult for parents juggling multiple children and multiple tasks. <br>
                    <br><span>Ms. Colbert:</span> I learned that children are very capable of learning and understanding technology quickly! Even my five and six year olds are pretty "tech-savvy" after months of practice!
