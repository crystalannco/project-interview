                <div class="conclusion">
                  <p> Through these interviews I have learned a great lesson in having empathy for teachers
                    and all they do in the classroom, especially when it comes to technology. Tehcnology is a definite
                    educational asset that all kids should be exposed to and have the opportunity to learn about and utilize.
                    However, trying to teach children using a format or resource that is unfamiliar can sometimes
                    be frustrating for teachers. This is why the role of customer support at a company like Skill Struck
                    is important. If teachers and students have the proper support, learning to use technology can be
                    both stress-free and beneficial for everyone!</p>
